So.... start of an online card game for 6 people playing 500!

Clone to repo, then:
* npm install
* npm start server.js

This will start a local http server on 8081 (Access by http://localhost:8081).

This way we can run it as a server, and access it with multi players using private browser tabs and other browsers... IE, shudder.

How good is this README!

Using this as a reference for multiplayer (got it running locally the example).

But anything on phaser is good too!
